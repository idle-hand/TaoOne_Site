<!-- In this HTML file, we've added an input field and a button for the user to enter their guess. We've also added a message element to display messages to the user, such as whether their guess is too low or too high.

When the user clicks the "Guess" button, the guessNumber() function is called. This function checks if the user's guess is valid (i.e., a number between 1 and 100) and then checks if the guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the guess is correct, the function displays a message with the number of guesses it took and disables the guess input field so the user can't keep guessing.-->
