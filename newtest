   <!-- In this example, the questions are stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a question with its options and correct answer. The renderQuestion function is responsible for rendering the current question and options to the page, while the checkAnswer function checks the selected answer and updates the score.

When the page loads, the first question is displayed using the renderQuestion function. The user can select an answer and submit it using the submit button, which will trigger the checkAnswer function to check the answer and render the next question (or display the final score if all questions have been answered). -->
